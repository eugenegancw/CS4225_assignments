**_Assignment 2_**

-   Task: Predict the daily trip counts using Citi bike data and other
    supporting datasets. For example, weather is an important factor
    affecting the daily trips in the bike-sharing business, so we will
    combine weather data with the Citi bike data to get some important
    features for making predictions.

-   Using the Databricks platform, I worked with Spark and used Python
    as a language of choice.

The notebook consists of the following steps:

1.  Download and preprocess CitiBike data

2.  Download and preprocess the weather data

3.  Combine all the data into a final table

4.  Filter the final table into Training Data and Testing Data

5.  Building ML pipeline using Training Data

6.  Evaluate ML pipeline using Testing Data & ensure MAE â‰¤ 12000
